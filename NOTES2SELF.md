# Notes to Self
## TODO
1. Code Cleanup
    - bogus user agents, state, large blocks of HTML
1. Add ability to remove/edit your own posts
1. Reply to comments within posts
    - Add an expiration time to comments in lscache
1. Think about actions for:
    - pages without posts
    - people who don't want to post/comment
    - IDEAS:
        - "check-in" to pages, like Foursquare
1. Options
    - turn off auto-search
1. Maybe move ALL HTML into Javascript b/c otherwise you have to remember which HTML goes where
1. User testing

Give up on UI aesthetics for now, get outside help
Things to do before User Testing:
    - add refresh button
    - auto refresh after user makes a post or comment
        - looks like Reddit doesn't refresh, just inserts the comment into the DOM

Where to get outside help?
    - ideally trustworthy
        - Alessia, Josh, Sami
    - if can't get the above ppl how do I recruit a trustworthy stranger
