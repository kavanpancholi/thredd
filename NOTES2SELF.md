1. User testing
1. Code Cleanup
    - bogus user agents, state, large blocks of HTML
    - bug fixin'

1. Move ALL HTML into Javascript b/c otherwise you have to remember which HTML goes where
1. Think about actions for:
    - pages without posts
    - people who don't want to post/comment
    - IDEAS:
        - "check-in" to pages, like Foursquare
