# Notes to Self
## TODO
1. Code Cleanup
    - bogus user agents, state
1. Reply to comments within posts
    - Clicking Reply button doesn't trigger expanding comments
        - could be achieved by putting dedicated button outside of collapsible div?
        - or dedicated "expand" / "show replies" button
    - Clear cache for current URL if user makes a post or comment (or refresh)
        - so they can see it in browser action window
    - [JS markdown editor](https://simplemde.com/)
1. UI aesthetics
    - Materialize UI on initial results page and also comments page
    - copy look of Reddit mobile app

1. Show users involved for a given URL and allow to add to friends list
    - connect with similar ppl
    - just send over to Reddit for now
1. Allow for subscribing to subreddits
    - just send the user over to Reddit for now
1. Think about actions for:
    - pages without posts
    - people who don't want to post/comment
    - IDEAS:
        - "check-in" to pages, like Foursquare
1. Look at the results for reddit.com for an example of what should ideally be avoided
    - Avoid NSFW subreddits (or at least set an option to avoid those subreddits)
1. Maybe move ALL HTML into Javascript b/c otherwise you have to remember which HTML goes where
1. User testing
1. Move all Reddit API calls to snoowrap
