# Notes to Self
## TODO
### Before release
1. User testing
1. Code Cleanup
    - bogus user agents, state, large blocks of HTML
    - bug fixin'
        - Raph still has "Loading..." bug
        - Display a Loading... message when loading comments
            - Josh thought that there were actually no comments b/c it was a long load time
        - could right-clicking Open In New Tab somehow keep popup window open?
1. CSS tweaks
    - remove misleading pointer cursor on post.html
    - color change after upvoting/downvoting
1. Consistent UI for post.html
1. Add ability to upvote/downvote, share/save, etc.
1. Add ability to remove/edit your own posts
1. Options
    - turn off auto-search
1. Not obvious how to log in
    - even less obvious to log out
1. Build website for Thredd
    - context menu link to provide feedback can go to website
1. How to position Thredd in the minds of users?
    - serendipitous connections, "water cooler moments" on the internet
    - look at Hypothesis then do the opposite of what they do
### After release
1. Move ALL HTML into Javascript b/c otherwise you have to remember which HTML goes where
1. Think about actions for:
    - pages without posts
    - people who don't want to post/comment
    - IDEAS:
        - "check-in" to pages, like Foursquare

Where to get outside help?
